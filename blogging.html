        Triple A games for the past 10 years have been known as phenomenal disappointments to gamers across the entire community, with very few exceptions in between. The main cause of such disappointment: cost to content ratio.  The history of gaming started offline, in a time when a game had to come completed or it would be shot down as a terrible buggy experience not worth the amount of money you paid for it.  Example such as most of the classic games everyone remembers such as Mario World 1-3, Donkey Kong Country, and most other games for the original Nintendo 64 system.  Similarly, even though the original Xbox had an online access system (Xbox Live) it’s games did not ship with bugs and unpatched.  Games would come fully functional with the complete set of content already included.  The decline in such value of an already purchased game came, at least in my experience, with Halo 3. <br>

        While a great standalone game in it’s own right, Halo 3 was one of the first triple A titles to include paid DLC that was required for online play.  The Mythic, Legendary, and Cold Storage map packs were required to even use certain online playlists, such as Big Team Deathmatch, and others.  While the DLC were all worth while, added 3-5 maps, of varying sizes and Forge possibility, it sparked an immense controversy among gamers with whether or not the content should have been free.  Traditionally, any sort of patch/dlc was usually free, with few exceptions, the Microsoft/Bungie received a large amount of flack.  In the end, at least in my perspective, the gaming community deemed the content “worth” the 5, or 10 dollars, with Cold Storage actually being free.  Unfortunately, the president had been set. <br>

        Games could now be shipped with content that wasn't included without content, and people would be fine with it.  Games started releasing with only a few maps for multiplayer, and the rest you had to get through paid DLC.  This process was made only worse with the smash hit, Minecraft.  Minecraft, created by Mojang, was crowd funded in it’s alpha stage on Kickstarter, making the first successful paid game pre release.  This caused a massive avalanche of games being sold pre-release to people who were fed lies of quality or features of the games by devs, leading to an era of people losing money to online liars, who weren't even intending on making games in the first place, just offering some half assed screenshots and concepts. <br>

        Probably the worst offender to date would be Dice, with the release of Star Wars Battlefront.  With the announcement of The Force Awakens, and the death of Lucas Art, the availability to cash in on a Star Wars game became too tempting, and Dice bought the rights from Disney to create a Battlefield esque fps game, with the same title as a beloved classic based in the Star Wars universe.  Costing 65$ as a standard release price, the game launched with 3 maps, 2 game modes, and zero campaign, which was previously a focal point of the series.  This trend of constant preordering being forced on consumers by stores like Gamestop in order to receive “exclusive” features such as skins, is a long con produce by game companies in order to have guaranteed money for a game, before reviews and opinion of the content even exists.  This will continue until preorder culture dies, and gaming can be a wholesale market once again.
